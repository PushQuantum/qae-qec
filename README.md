# Quantum Autoencoders for Quantum Error Correction
This a project aimed at replicating the results from the arXiV paper on using [Quantum Autoencoders for Quantum Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00555). The results in this paper was achieved by using DQNNs ([Disspiative Quantum Neural Networks](https://github.com/qigitphannover/DeepQuantumNeuralNetworks)) with code written in MATLAB and they are numerical simulation results. 

Desired Objectives for this project:
-[ ] Replicate the results but using Python 
  - Plans to use TFQuantum and Cirq for this.
-[ ] Run the learned encodings and decodings on actual hardware.
-[ ]Try gradient free methods for neural network training, trying an alternate solution for the Barren Plateau problem.
